A repository for learning GitHub and making very close friends.

-I spend most of my time working on school work, even though I would rather be sleeping\
-I enjoy creating data parsing programs with Python, even though I should focus on learning more Java\
-I love to play the Accordion, even I could be playing the Piano\
-Paramore is my favorite band, and I love listening to film scores
